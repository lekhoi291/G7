                                they started ranting about how hard it was to get a taxi.</p>
                                <p>But afterwards, they did something uncommon.</p>
                                <p>They decided to solve the problem. They started us, 
                                G7 (then MyTeksi). Pretty soon, our simple goal had transformed into something 
                                bigger – to make Southeast Asia a better place.</p>

                                Friends. Family. And whatever we do, it’s to

                        <h1>G7 in a nutshell</h1>
                        <p>The goals we’ve set for ourselves aren’t easy to achieve. 
                        But we believe one day soon, every single person in 
                        Southeast Asia<br> will be able to travel safely, 
                        comfortably, and easily to work, to college,
                        and to tea with a few friends.</p>
                        <p>With every single day that passes, we’re more certain of it. 
                        Because we have you to help get us there. That’s 
                        what G7 is<br> really about. Bringing people 
                        together to make life better for all.</p>
